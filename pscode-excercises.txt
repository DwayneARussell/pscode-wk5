// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

firstnumber + secondnumber

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if number is even, show even
if number is odd, show odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) take five numbers

b) add the five numbers together and divide by 5 = avg

c) Min = firstnumber
Is secondnumber < Min
	Yes: Min = secondnumber
	No: Min is unchanged
Is thirdnumber < Min
	Yes: Min = thirdnumber
	No: Min is unchanged
Is fourthnumber < Min
	Yes: Min = fourthnumber
	No: Min is unchanged
Is fifthnumber < Min
	Yes: Min = fifthnumber
	No: Min is unchanged

Max = firstnumber
Is secondnumber > Max
	Yes: Max = secondnumber
	No: Max is unchanged
Is thirdnumber > Max
	Yes: Max = thirdnumber
	No: Max is unchanged
Is fourthnumber > Max
	Yes: Max = fourthnumber
	No: Max is unchanged
Is fifthnumber > Max
	Yes: Max = fifthnumber
	No: Max is unchanged

d) show Min = and its total and show Max = and its total
